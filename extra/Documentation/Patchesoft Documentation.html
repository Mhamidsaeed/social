<p></p><p>Social Network is a PHP product that allows you to create your
 own Social Network. Users can make posts, make friends, upload photos 
and more!</p>
<p></p>

<hr>


<h3 id="document-166">Simple Setup - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Installing the software is simple. You'll need the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>FTP Details</li>
	<li>MYSQL database details (username, password, database).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Uploading Files</h1>

<ul>
	<li>First locate the core files in the folder: <strong>core_files/core.zip </strong>and extract them.</li>
	<li>Upload the files to your main web directory. A sub folder is fine too.</li>
	<li>CHMOD the following files temporarily to <strong>0777</strong>: <strong>application/config/config.php</strong>, <strong>application/config/database.php</strong> and <strong>.htaccess</strong> (in the root folder).</li>
	<li>Run the <strong>setup.php</strong> file in the main document of the file. So if you installed your site in <strong>http://www.example.com/mysite/</strong>, you would run <strong>http://www.example.com/mysite/setup.php</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/step1.png" style="height:769px; width:1181px"></p>

<ul>
	<li>Follow the step by step instructions that allow you to setup the system.</li>
	<li>If you have issues using the setup.php file, please refer to the <strong>Setup &amp; Installation document</strong> which will give you a step by step guide of setting up the system manually.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want a more detailed install guide which explains everything 
more clearly, check out our Setup &amp; Installation document.</p>

<h2>How to CHMOD</h2>

<p>CHMOD is the process of setting a file's read/write permissions. In 
order to run the setup.php, it needs to be able to write to 3 core files
 temporarily whilst you run the setup. You'll need to set the files 
above to 0777 which grants the setup the correct access. To CHMOD a 
file, you need to navigate to the file in your FTP and right click the 
file. You'll want to look for something like permissions, chmod, or 
properties. Here you'll be able to set the CHMOD value.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/chmod.png"></p>

<p>Once you have completed the setup, chmod the files back to their default of <strong>0644</strong>.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-167">Setup &amp; Installation - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<h1>Quick Setup</h1>

<p>If you want to run the quick setup file, please refer to the Simple 
Setup document. This file will quickly setup your system for you, all 
you need to do is provide the correct details for your website. If 
you're having trouble using the simple setup, follow this guide to 
manually run the setup.</p>

<h1>Uploading Files</h1>

<p>Once you have downloaded your file from the Envato Marketplace, you 
will need to extract the files from the ZIP file. You will need to 
upload the product core files to a webserver. First locate the core 
files in the folder: <strong>core_files/core.zip</strong>. You will need
 to extract the files from the zip and upload them so that these files 
are in your main directory on your webserver, usually this is the 
public_html folder. If you wish to upload them to a sub-folder, this is 
fine too- just make sure you read the footnotes about installing in a 
sub-folder.</p>

<p>Your webserver's main directory should look something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="Directory Structure" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/directory_structure.png"></p>

<h1>Config Settings</h1>

<p>Before you can use your product, you will need to edit the config files. First locate the config file in: <strong>application/config/config.php</strong> and open it up using a text editor such as notepad. The only line you should need to edit is the:</p>

<pre>$config['base_url']	= 'http://www.example.com/';</pre>

<p>Replace the http://www.example.com with your own domain name, making 
sure you keep the quotation tags around it as above. There are some 
other settings that you can also edit in this file if you feel the need 
to customise your product further but for a basic installation this is 
all you should need to edit. Save the file and overwrite the existing 
one on your webserver.</p>

<h1>Database Settings</h1>

<p>The second file you will need to edit is your database file. Find the file: <strong>application/config/database.php</strong>
 and open it up using a text editor like Notepad. You will need to edit 
the lines listed below with your own database login information. For the
 most part, host stays the same as localhost unless your web host 
specifies to you otherwise. You will need your database name, database 
username and database password.</p>

<pre>$db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';
$db['default']['username'] = 'your_username';
$db['default']['password'] = 'your_password';
$db['default']['database'] = 'database_name';
</pre>

<p>Once you have modified this file, save it and overwrite the existing one on your webserver.</p>

<p>Next you will need to execute the SQL file that came with the product
 download. This file will create the database tables that are used to 
store the data of your application. Usually you can import the SQL 
tables by using a database management system like PHPmyAdmin. The SQL 
file is located in <strong>core_files/database.sql</strong> in the product download.</p>

<p>To Import the file, login to your database management system, such as
 PHPmyAdmin. Make sure you are on the database that you named in the 
database.php config file then locate the Import Tab on PHPmyAdmin.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/import.png" style="height:867px; width:1096px"></p>

<p>Next select the browse button (as shown in the screenshot above) and locate the SQL file (<strong>core_files/database.sql</strong>) from your product download file. Next click the Go! button and you should now see database tables appear in the left sidebar.</p>

<h1>Mod Rewrite</h1>

<p>We use a URL routing trick called mod_rewrite. This is normally 
installed by default on most web servers and allows for URLS like: 
http://www.example.com/some/file/here/ instead of 
http://www.example.com/myfile.php.</p>

<p>If you don't have mod_rewrite settings enabled on your web server, 
you can still use the application by setting your index_page value to 
the following line in the <strong>application/config/config.php</strong> file:</p>

<pre>$config['index_page'] = 'index.php';</pre>

<p>This setting will make it so your URLs have index.php in them. 
However, the default setting is to remove this and assumes you have 
mod_rewrite enabled on your webserver.</p>

<h1>Creating the Admin Account and Setup Site</h1>

<p>Finally, you will need to run the install file in your web browser. A
 notification will pop-up on the site once you have filled out all the 
database settings and config settings linking you to the install file. 
Or you can locate it by going to <strong>http://www.example.com/install/</strong>
 where example.com is replaced by your own. Here you'll be able to 
create the Admin account with full access to the site as well as some 
initial site settings.</p>

<p>If you're having problems accessing this URL, double-check that you entered the correct information in the <strong>application/config/config.php</strong>
 file. If you are sure that it is correct, it may be something to do 
with your webserver's settings with allowing mod_rewrite. The problem 
most notably is usually with the <strong>.htaccess</strong> file in the 
main directory- make sure this file is in your main directory (like in 
the directory screenshot above). If you still have problems, check out 
our Knowlege Base or feel free to contact us.</p>

<p>If you added index.php to your config setting <strong>index_page </strong>in the<strong> </strong><strong>application/config/config.php</strong> file, the URL to install will be: <strong>http://www.mydomain.com/index.php/install/</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Once you have installed the product, please delete the file <strong>application/controllers/install.php</strong>! This will prevent other users from messing up your settings. Please also delete <strong>setup.php</strong> and <strong>setup_db.sql</strong> in the main directory.</p>

<h1>Installing In A Sub-Folder</h1>

<p>If you're installing the software in a sub-folder, such as 
http://www.example.com/my_subfolder/ then you will need to modify the 
.htaccess file inside the main directory (the one that holds the 
application, bootstrap folders etc). All you need to do is open up the 
.htaccess file in your text editor and copy the following code, 
replacing the sub-folder with the name of your sub-folder (in this 
example, the sub-folder is called sub_folder_name_here. Replace this 
with the name of your sub-folder).</p>

<pre>RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /sub_folder_name_here
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php?/$1 
</pre>

<p>Save the file as .htaccess and overwrite the one inside your main 
directory that you used to install the software in (the folder 
containing the application, bootstrap folders etc). You can skip this 
step if you're installing in your main folder.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-168">Where Everything Is - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>This part of the guide is to show you where the most common elements 
of the site are located. Remember, this site uses CodeIgniter Framework,
 so for well-documented additional support, please use their website and
 user guide: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a></p>

<h3>Styling &amp; CSS</h3>

<p>The site's styling is based off Bootstrap 3; Bootstrap 3 comes with 
lots of predefined CSS elements that you can use to create well 
presented websites with. You can view the Bootstrap documentation and 
examples here: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">http://getbootstrap.com/</a>. If you wish to upgrade the Bootstrap version or make your own changes to it, you can find the files in the <strong>bootstrap/</strong> directory.</p>

<p>The product also uses it's own custom styling to create the site layout. You can find the stylesheet file in <strong>styles</strong> folder.</p>

<h3>Modify HTML / Frontend interface</h3>

<p>The template files, also known as views, can be found in <strong>application/views/</strong>.
 These files contain the HTML of the site and modifying these files 
allows you to change the way the site presents data. These files also 
contain some PHP code so it's important to know what you're doing when 
editting these files.</p>

<p>The layout file can be found in <strong>application/views/layout/layout.php</strong>.</p>

<h3>PHP Logic &amp; Database Models</h3>

<p>The controller files, which contain the site logic, can be found in <strong>application/controllers/</strong> folder. These are PHP files that are used to control how the site works.</p>

<p>The model files can be found in <strong>application/models/</strong> which contain the database logic.</p>

<h3>Javascript &amp; Libraries</h3>

<p>The Javascript files can be found in the <strong>scripts/</strong> folder. The <strong>custom/</strong> folder contains custom made scripts for the site and the <strong>libraries/</strong> folder contains 3rd-party plugins that we use.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-174">Frontpage - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Upon successfully installing the Social Network system, you'll be 
presented with a frontpage similar to the screenshot below. This guide 
will discuss some of the options and what the features are present.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/frontpage.png"></p>

<p>The list of posts seen by the logged in user on the frontpage is a 
collboration of Friends and Pages that you are members with, including 
your own posts. When you make a friend with another user, all their 
posts will become available to you to view, likewise when you become a 
member of a page.</p>

<p>Each post can be commented on and liked. Whenever someone 
likes/comments on one of your posts, you'll get a notification in your 
notification box.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/posting.png" style="height:312px; width:941px"></p>

<p>When making a post, you have a list of options available to you, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Attach an image/video - you can upload an image or video file. 
Images are automatically added to your Album Feed category. You can also
 link to YouTube Videos by copying the URL into the YouTube field.</li>
	<li>Assign a Location to your post - Using Google Maps, you can search 
for a location to let people know where you are. When your post is made,
 the location will be assigned next to it.</li>
	<li>Assign Users - you can also assign multiple users to your post to let other's know you are currently with them.</li>
	<li>Emjois - A selection of emojis are available for you to use too.</li>
</ul>

<p>When making a post, you can also mention other users by using the 
@name of the person you want to mention. They'll receive a notification 
whenever they are mentioned by you.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/hashtags.png"></p>

<p>Finally, you can also use #hashtags to have your posts visible by 
anyone searching for that current hashtag. Hashtags which are mentioned 
more often will show up under the trending sidebar. If you want to reset
 the hashtag trending area, you can run the cron <strong>cron/reset_hashtag</strong>. This will reset the count of how many times a hashtag has been used (use this to setup daily/monthly trending hashtags).</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/post_options.png"></p>

<p>Each post has a dropdown menu assigned to it, which when clicked will
 show a list of post options. These options include Turn Off 
Notifications for a post, Save the post to your Saved Posts section and 
if you made the post, Edit and Delete options.</p>

<p>Posts are loaded by scrolling to the bottom of the page. It loads 10 new posts each time you reach the bottom.</p>

<p>The frontpage also has two areas to display newest users and newest 
pages created. Users can use these to discover new users and/or new 
pages.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-175">Profiles - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Each user has a profile that they can customize to their liking. The 
image options include uploading an avatar and a profile header image. 
These can be done in the user's settings page.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/profile.png"></p>

<p>The profile of a user shows posts only made by that user and if 
user's attempt to post on their profile. These same options are 
available for posting, including tagging, mentions, location and 
uploading images/video.</p>

<p>Each user can be friends with other users, unless the user has friend
 requests turned off in their privacy settings. On a user's profile, 
you'll see a list of friends that the user is friends with. If the 
profile is your own, the option to defriend users will become available.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/albums.png"></p>

<p>Each user can also create Albums that can be used to categorize 
images you have uploaded. By default, when you upload an image from a 
post, it is automatically added to the Feed Album. This album is a 
special album that cannot be deleted and is the default album that newly
 uploaded images from posts are added to.</p>

<p>Users can create multiple albums to organise their images. Users can 
upload either one file at a time or a batch of files using the 
mutli-photo uploaded. When a photo is uploaded, there is also the option
 to make a Feed Post about it, so that other users can comment and like 
it.</p>

<p>Users can change the permissions of who can post on their wall and view their profile in the Permission Settings.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-177">Pages - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>Pages are a section of the site that a user can use to make their own
 custom page that other members can view/join. Pages work similarly to 
profiles, only that they are not related to a single user but a group of
 users.</p>

<p>A user can create a new page if they have the <strong>Page Creator</strong> User Role. Like with Profiles, the user can customize the Page's avatar and profile header.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/page.png"></p>

<p>A page can either be Public or Private. Public pages can be viewed by
 anyone whereas Private pages need to you to have an invite in order to 
see the page. All public pages can be viewed in the All Pages section.</p>

<p>Settings for each page include being able to restrict who can post on
 the Page's Frontpage (only page admins, members or everyone) and also 
the option to restrict Albums, Members and Events to members of the 
page.</p>

<p>Each page has a Members section which lists all the page's members. 
Members of a page can have one of two roles: Member or Admin. Page 
Admins can update the page's settings, invite other users and more.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/events.png"></p>

<p>Each page has it's own Event section. Here a Page Admin can add 
Events to their page, which can then be marked as attended by its page's
 members. Events are shown in a Calendar, so that users can see when the
 Event is. Clicking on an Event will reveal more information, including 
Time, Location and other details. When an event is created, there is 
also the option for the page to make a post about it.</p>

<p>Similarly, each Page has it's own Albums section for uploading and organising images.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-179">Chat System - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The chat system on the Social Network system allows users who are 
friends with each other to engage in live chat. The application doesn't 
require anything extra to run. It updates the chat every 5 seconds and 
issues a sound alert when you have a new message.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/chat.png"></p>

<p>When chatting, you can minimize the box, close it or delete the chat.
 When you delete a chat, the other user is notified. You can have 
multiple chat windows open at a time.</p>

<p>You can disable the Live Chat aspect in the Admin Panel under Global Settings.</p>

<p>Users can also use the Inbox function to send messages to each other.
 This area is more static and uses less resources as it isn't 
auto-updating every 5 seconds.</p>


<hr>

<h3 id="document-176">Admin Panel - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The Admin Panel is accessible to users who have the User Role <strong>Admin, Admin Settings </strong>or <strong>Admin Members</strong>. The Admin Panel offers a range of options that can help you manage the Social Network system.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/admin.png"></p>

<p>The <strong>Global Settings</strong> page allows you to change the layout of the site, including name, logo and many other options.</p>

<p><strong>User Groups</strong> User Groups allow you to group users together. If you need to keep your members organised, you can assign them into groups.</p>

<p><strong>IP Blocking</strong> IP Blocking prevents users from logging in using a specific IP.</p>

<p><strong>Page Categories</strong> allow you to create categories that users can assign to their page.</p>

<p><strong>Social Settings</strong> are used for setting up logging in with other Social Media networks, including Facebook, Google and Twitter.</p>

<p>The Admin panel also allows you to manage all your Members. You can 
edit/delete/add members. You can see all their information by clicking 
on Edit User. You can change their password, email address and also 
their User Role.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/user_roles.png"></p>

<p>The software also has a powerful <strong>User Role</strong> system. 
It allows you to completely control the permissions users have on your 
site. You can create custom roles with different permissions and assign 
them to individual users. This section describes all the User Roles and 
what permissions they give. You can view what each role does by hovering
 over the Role in the Admin Panel.</p>

<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1">
	<tbody>
		<tr>

<p>You can mix permissions together. So you could have a User Role 
called Intern and give them the roles of Finance Viewer, Behaviour 
Viewer and Student Viewer.</p>

<h3 id="document-169">Application Structure - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>This application is built up around the CodeIgniter framework. 
CodeIgniter is built directly into the software, so you don't have to do
 anything extra to use it.</p>

<p>For developers, this framework is freely available on the internet 
and documentation for using the source code can be founded on their 
website: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a>.</p>

<p>CodeIgniter is a PHP Framework written in MVC (model-view-controller)
 format which allows developers to create applications that are 
structured in a very clean and efficient way. When you unzip the product
 download (core_files/code.zip), you will be presented with the 
following directory structure. Below is a quick overview of where you 
can find various files if you are new to using CodeIgniter.</p>

<p><img alt="Directory Structure" src="Patchesoft%20Documentation_files/directory_structure.png" style="height:227px; width:205px"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>application</strong> - This is where the main application 
files are kept. It includes the configuaration files, the class 
controllers, models and view files. If you want to make changes to the 
application, you should modify these files.</li>
	<li><strong>bootstrap</strong> - The bootstrap Javascript and CSS files.</li>
	<li><strong>images</strong> - Images used in the application are stored here.</li>
	<li><strong>scripts</strong> - Custom Javascript files made for use with the application.</li>
	<li><strong>styles</strong> - Custom CSS files made for use with the application.</li>
	<li><strong>system</strong> - The core CodeIgniter files are present here. These should not be modified unless upgrading the CodeIgniter version.</li>
	<li><strong>uploads</strong> - This folder is used to store user uploads.</li>
	<li><strong>user_guide</strong> - Documentation on how to use CodeIgniter.</li>
	<li><strong>.htaccess</strong> - This file is used to tell your web server to process URLs.</li>
	<li><strong>index.php</strong> - The application bootup file.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information on directory structure at the CodeIgniter website and reading the User Guide: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a></p>

<h3 id="document-170">Modifying the HTML &amp; CSS - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>You can modify the HTML and CSS of the product to match the look and 
feel of your website. You can manually edit the CSS files that control 
the site's look and feel.</p>

<p>You can find the CSS file in <strong>styles/main.css</strong>. Here 
you will be able to see the current rules that have been created for the
 site. You may want to put your own rules at the bottom of the file, or 
even create your own CSS file and include that into the site layout. 
This will be useful should you ever wish to upgrade the product with a 
newer version and your settings won't be overwritten.</p>

<p>You may also wish to change the HTML of the site. All HTML files are inside the <strong>application/views/</strong> folders. The layout HTML file can be found in <strong>application/views/layout/layout.php</strong>.
 This file is the core of the site structure. There are some PHP coding 
inside the HTML files which is used to generate the dynamic content; we 
suggest not modifying these as it could cause unexpected errors in your 
system.</p>

<p>Remember, you can find out more information on how to use Views, 
Controllers and Models using the CodeIgniter framework by reading their 
documentation: <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/">http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/</a></p>

<h3 id="document-171">Languages - <a href="#top">top</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>If you would like to translate your product into another language, 
then you can do so by modifying the language files. Follow the simple 
steps below to get started:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a new folder inside the application/language/ folder. Give 
the folder the name of your language, such as spanish, italian etc. For 
this example, I will call mine <strong>french</strong>.</li>
	<li>Copy the 3 files from inside application/language/english/ to the newly created folder that you just made.</li>
	<li>Inside your new language folder you should now have a <strong>content_lang.php</strong>, <strong>error_lang.php</strong> and <strong>success_lang.php</strong>. You can also add the index.html file too.</li>
</ol>

<p>You are now ready to begin editting these files.</p>

<p>The <strong>content_lang.php</strong> contains all translations for most of the content pages on the site. The <strong>error_lang.php</strong>
 file contains all the error messages that are given to users when they 
do something wrong. You are free to translate them all or just a few. 
The main one should be the content_lang.php as those translations are 
the ones your users will mostly see.</p>

<p>To edit the translations, all you need to do is type the new correct 
text inside the double quotes. For example, the following is a couple of
 lines from the content_lang.php file:</p>

<pre>			$lang['ctn_3'] = "Provide Us Feedback";
			$lang['ctn_4'] = "Email Address";
		</pre>

<p>To translate, you just need to modify the text within the double quotes. For example, a french translation would be:</p>

<pre>			$lang['ctn_3'] = "Fournir nous Commentaires";
			$lang['ctn_4'] = "Adresse e-mail";
		</pre>

<p>Save the file when your done. The final step for your translations to
 take place, you need to edit the application/config/config.php file. 
Change the following line:</p>

<pre>		$config['language']	= 'english';
		</pre>

<p>to the name of the folder that you stored your new language files in. In my case, it was french, so I change it to:</p>

<pre>		$config['language']	= 'french';
		</pre>

<p>Save config.php and you should see your new translations take place.</p>

<p><strong>Extra</strong></p>

<p>You may also need to add the System translation files. These files 
are for generic System errors. We recommend performing the following 
steps:</p>

<p>You&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;create&nbsp;a&nbsp;folder&nbsp;in&nbsp;your&nbsp;Systems&nbsp;language&nbsp;folder&nbsp;for&nbsp;your&nbsp;new&nbsp;language.
 The folder name needs to be the same name as your new language. In the 
example below, it's "<strong>spanish</strong>". Please&nbsp;follow&nbsp;these&nbsp;steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1)&nbsp;Create&nbsp;a&nbsp;folder&nbsp;inside&nbsp;system/language/&nbsp;called&nbsp;<strong>spanish</strong></li>
	<li>2)&nbsp;Locate&nbsp;the&nbsp;following&nbsp;folder:&nbsp;system/language/english/</li>
	<li>3)&nbsp;Copy&nbsp;all&nbsp;the&nbsp;files&nbsp;inside&nbsp;this&nbsp;folder&nbsp;to&nbsp;your&nbsp;newly&nbsp;created&nbsp;folder&nbsp;(system/language/<strong>spanish</strong>/)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Dynamic/Multiple Languages</h1>

<p>This software also has the option for the user to change the language
 themselves. The available languages are based on the translations you 
have done. A user can change the language of the site by clicking the 
Change Language link in the footer of the site.</p>

<p>You can add as many available languages are you like. You just need 
to make sure you have created the language files and folders, as 
outlined in the guide above.</p>

<p>To make a language available for selection, you need to edit the main
 config file: application/config/config.php. Look for this line:</p>

<pre>			$config['available_languages'] = array(
	          "english" =&gt; array(
		      "display_name" =&gt; "English",
		      "rtl_support" =&gt; 0
	          )
            );
</pre>

<p>This is where you need to add your other languages. For example, to add your French language, edit the code so it says:</p>

<pre>			$config['available_languages'] = array(
	          "english" =&gt; array(
		      "display_name" =&gt; "English",
		      "rtl_support" =&gt; 0
	          ),
              "french" =&gt; array(
		      "display_name" =&gt; "French",
		      "rtl_support" =&gt; 0
	          )
            );
</pre>

<p>Now when the user visits the Change Language page, the option for 
French will appear in the menu. Remember, make sure the language files 
(in this case French) have been added too as outlined in the Language 
Guide above.</p>

<p><strong>RTL-SUPPORT</strong>: If you need to enable right-to-left 
text, for your language you need to change "rtl_support" =&gt; 0 to 
"rtl_support" =&gt; 1. This will then set the page to change text to 
RTL.</p>
